    "# Bridge and torch problem with python and AI\n",
    "## Story\n",
    "Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. The bridge can carry only two persons. Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?\n",
    "The problem can be stated as \n",
    "* A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge.\n",
    "* B takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge.\n",
    "* C takes 5 minutes to cross the bridge.\n",
    "* D takes 8 minutes to cross the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "We have used heuristic based random search to get a final solution. The solution is made easier by using the following constrains\n",
    "* Two persons must cross the bridge in the forward direction, but only one person will go back. \n",
    "* A, B must start first, they are the first pair that will pass the bridge"
