# Solving the bridge and torch problem with python and AI
## Story
Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, can they all get across the bridge if the torch lasts only 15 minutes?

## Solution approach with AI
The solution is provided as heuristic based random search. The algorithm applies the following constraints to get a final solution. 
* A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge.
* B takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge.
* C takes 5 minutes to cross the bridge.
* D takes 8 minutes to cross the bridge.

There is only one torch with them and the bridge cannot be crossed without the torch. There cannot be more than two persons on the bridge at any time, and when two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower personâ€™s pace.

## The code


```python
import random
import pdb
states={
    # False here means that the person didn't pass the bridge
    # True means he/she passed the bridge
    'Torch':False,
    'A':False,
    'B':False,
    'C':False,
    'D':False
}
times={
    # time in minutes, person1 A can pass the bridge in 1 minute
    'A':1,
    'B':2,
    'C':5,
    'D':8
}

```

## Solution		
* 2 minutes	    A and B cross forward, taking 2 minutes	A B
* 3 minutes	  	A returns, taking 1 minute	   B
* 11 minutes		C and D cross forward, taking 8 minutes	   B C D
* 13 minutes		B returns, taking 2 minutes	      C D
* 15 minutes		A and B cross forward, taking 2 minutes	A B C D
